# REST-Countries-API-with-color-theme-switcher
This is my solution for REST Countries API with color theme switcher. I would be happy to have comments on the way it has been done. It has been done mainly using HTML , CSS , JS and API. Please tell me, what could be improved and what has not been done properly ? Thanks !
